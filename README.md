R-I-Basics

This is the repo for the workshop that focuses on Part I of (the soon-to-be-renamed) [Data Processing and Visualization](https://m-clark.github.io/data-processing-and-visualization)


Run the following in your R session to get the notes and materials for the workshop.  Change the `destdir` to save the project in a specific place (not necessary, should default to desktop).  It will open the RStudio project for you.

```
install.packages('usethis')

usethis::use_course('https://github.com/m-clark/R-I-Basics/blob/master/workshop_data_processing.zip?raw=true', destdir = NULL)
```

If you have issues, just download that zip file (click or paste into your browser), unzip it to a location of your choosing, then:

- Click on the blue .Rproj icon inside

OR

- With RStudio - File/Open Project - Navigate to the folder - Open




With your RStudio project set up, you may read the `ReadMe.md`, open `code/install_script_data_processing.R` and run it.
